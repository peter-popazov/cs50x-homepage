              King on the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September
              2022. In addition to his official and ceremonial duties in the
              United Kingdom and overseas as The Prince of Wales, His Majesty
              has taken a keen and active interest in all areas of public life
              for decades. The King has been instrumental in establishing more
              than 20 charities over 40 years, including The Prince's Trust, The
              Prince's Foundation and The Prince of Walesâ€™s Charitable Fund
              (PWCF). His Majesty has worked closely with many organisations,
              publicly supporting a wide variety of causes relating to the
              environment, rural communities, the built environment, the arts,
              healthcare and education.

              The Prince of Wales, eldest son of The Queen and Prince Philip,
              Duke of Edinburgh, was born at Buckingham Palace at 9.14pm on 14
              November 1948. A month later, on 15 December, Charles Philip
              Arthur George was christened in the Music Room at Buckingham
              Palace, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Geoffrey Fisher.

            <p class="main-text">
              The Prince's mother was proclaimed Queen Elizabeth II at the age
              of 25, when her father, King George VI, died aged 56 on 6 February
              1952. On The Queen's accession to the throne, Prince Charles - as
              the Sovereign's eldest son - became heir apparent at the age of
              three. The Prince, as Heir to the Throne, took on the traditional
              titles of The Duke of Cornwall under a charter of King Edward III
              in 1337; and, in the Scottish peerage, of Duke of Rothesay, Earl
              of Carrick, Baron Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great
              Steward of Scotland. The Prince was four at his mother's
              Coronation, in Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953. Many who watched
              the Coronation have vivid memories of him seated between his
              widowed grandmother, known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,
              and his aunt, Princess Margaret.

              The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh decided that The Prince should
              go to school rather than have a tutor at the Palace. The Prince
              started at Hill House school in West London on 7 November 1956.
              After 10 months, the young Prince became a boarder at Cheam
              School, a preparatory school in Berkshire. In 1958, while The
              Prince was at Cheam, The Queen created him The Prince of Wales and
              Earl of Chester. The Prince was nine-years-old. The Queen and The
