              Mrs Rosalind Shand was 72 when she died in 1994 as a result of
              osteoporosis. The Queen's grandmother had died from the same
              condition eight years earlier. The Queen has served as President
              of the Royal Osteoporosis Society since 2001, having supported the
              charity since 1994.

              Windsor. They were joined by around 800 guests at a Service of
              Prayer and Dedication at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The
              Service was followed by a reception at Windsor Castle hosted by
